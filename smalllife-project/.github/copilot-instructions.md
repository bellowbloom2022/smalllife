# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions — Small Llife

Purpose: Give AI coding agents the exact, actionable knowledge to be productive in this Unity project.

- Project type: Unity 2D/3D game project. Primary source lives under `Assets/` and game settings under `ProjectSettings/`.
- Build system: open with the Unity Editor matching the project's packages. Use `Packages/manifest.json` to choose Unity Editor version family and installed packages.

Key directories and roles
- `Assets/Script/`: main C# gameplay and editor scripts. Start here for gameplay logic changes.
- `Assets/Scenes/`: scene assets that define game flow. Editing scenes usually requires Unity Editor changes.
- `Assets/Prefabs/` and `Assets/Resources/`: reusable GameObjects and runtime-loadable assets. Search for `Resources.Load` usages (examples under `Assets/TextMesh Pro/Examples & Extras/Scripts`).
- `Plugins/`: native or 3rd-party binaries — treat carefully and don't modify ABI-sensitive files.
- `Packages/manifest.json`: external package list (TextMeshPro, Cinemachine, Test Framework, Visual Studio/VSCode Rider integrations).
- `Assembly-CSharp*.csproj`: C# assembly project files generated by Unity — changes here are usually auto-managed by Unity.

Architecture notes (big picture)
- Unity-driven runtime: scenes + prefabs + scripts. Most cross-component communication happens through Unity components (MonoBehaviours), serialized fields, and Resources/Prefabs.
- Editor vs runtime code: scripts placed in `Editor/` are compiled into editor-only assemblies (Assembly-CSharp-Editor). Respect Unity compilation order and folders named `Editor`.
- Serialization & GUIDs: Unity uses `.meta` files and GUIDs to track assets. Avoid editing `.meta`, `Library/`, or `Temp/` files by hand.

Common patterns to follow
- Resource loading: use `Resources.Load` for assets in `Assets/Resources/`; examples exist in `Assets/TextMesh Pro/Examples & Extras/Scripts`.
- Text & UI: project includes TextMesh Pro assets and examples — prefer TextMeshPro workflow over legacy `GUIText`.
- Localization/3rd-party libs: check `Assets/` for `LeanLocalization` and similar packages; prefer package-managed updates via `Packages/manifest.json`.

Build, test, and debug workflows
- Open project via Unity Editor (recommended) to run scenes and play-mode tests. Use the same Editor major version as installed packages if possible.
- Command-line build (example):
  - /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<version>/Unity -batchmode -quit -projectPath <path> -executeMethod <BuildClass.Method>
- Debugging: attach debugger to the Unity Editor process (Visual Studio, Rider, or VS Code with the Unity Debugger). For macOS attach to the Editor process.
- Tests: Unity Test Framework is installed (`com.unity.test-framework`). Run tests from the Editor Test Runner or via command line using test-runner APIs.

What to avoid / gotchas
- Do not edit `Library/`, `Temp/`, or other generated folders. They are machine-specific and will be ignored by source control.
- Avoid changing `.meta` GUIDs — renames/moves should be done in Unity Editor to preserve references.
- Native plugin changes in `Plugins/` may require platform-specific rebuilds.

Examples to search when making changes
- Find game-entry points: search `Assets/Scenes/` for the initial scene and `Assets/Script/` for scene controller components.
- Resource usage: grep for `Resources.Load` (many examples inside `Assets/TextMesh Pro/Examples & Extras/Scripts`).
- Editor-only code: search for `namespace UnityEditor` or files under `Assets/Editor`.

If you need more context
- Read `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` and `Packages/manifest.json` to find player settings and installed packages.
- Inspect `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` when troubleshooting compilation issues from the IDE.

When in doubt, ask the maintainers: prefer small, reversible changes and validate in the Unity Editor before merging.

If any of these pointers need clarification or you want additional examples (scene entry points, common MonoBehaviour base classes, or a list of frequently-edited scripts), tell me which area to expand.
